mmap((void *)0x0,0x1000,7,0x22,-1,0)

addr = 0x0
len = 4096 bytes
prot = 7 = 111
flags = 0x22 = 100010
fd = -1
offset = 0

For some reason this mmap does not make it possible to do a call back up in the code.
We need to get the needed addreses of /bin/sh and NULL by doing a call forward and adding an offset to the current instruction pointer.
