This binary has ALL protections enabled, so although we can easily leak a stack address, we cannot execute the stack.

However at the start of main it does a call to memprotect, which changes the permissions of 1000 bytes below the GOT.
This includes the bss buffer at the start.
Then, from main we can leak the "ebp" (not really ebp, I do not know what it is) and get an address to the source code, libc_csu_fini.
From there, getting to the bss is just computing an offset. We give the bss address to the EIP, overwrite the correct canary and get a shell.
