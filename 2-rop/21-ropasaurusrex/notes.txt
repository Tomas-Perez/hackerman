Binary is stripped, so we cannot just search for "main" in ghidra to find the main. We find the "entry" function which will call libc_start_main with the address of main.

Multistage exploit:
1. Use a call to the write reference in the binary to leak the libc address of read from the GOT. 
    The address of read will be available, as read was already called in order to get user input.
    The buffer is the address for the read entry in the GOT, and we want to read 4 bytes for a 32-bit address. 
    We make write return to the start of main, in order to get a read again.
2. From the leaked read address, compute the addresses to system and /bin/sh.
3. Send a new payload that calls system with /bin/sh using the computed addresses.
