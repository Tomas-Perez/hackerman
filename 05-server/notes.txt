Need to connect to server via remote (even if it is running locally), running the process locally does not work as it is not using stdin/stdout.

Even though we can run /bin/sh, as we still dont have stdin, there is no way to interact with the shell through interactive.

No stdin == no way of sending data to the server after running /bin/sh
No stdout == no way of receiving data from the server after running /bin/sh

How do we run "cat flag" and keep reading and writing to the socket file descriptor??

See:
- https://0x00sec.org/t/remote-exploit-shellcode-without-sockets/1440 
- https://0x00sec.org/t/remote-shells-part-i/269

We can reroute stdin, stdout and stderr to the fd of the socket.
