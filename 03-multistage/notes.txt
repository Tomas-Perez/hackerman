Global buffer is 20 bytes long

*param_1 = buffer._0_8_;
param_1[1] = buffer._8_8_;
*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 2) = buffer._16_4_;

get_name copies global buffer to name buffer.
    1. Copy 8 bytes from position 0
    2. Copy 8 bytes from position 8 (position 1 in a 8 byte pointer)
    3. Copy 4 bytes from position 16 (position 2 in a 4 byte pointer)

name buffer is 32 bytes long (actually 20 bytes but stack alignment rounds up to 32)
